- First meeting, we looked over our central question to get a final picture and
  plan of how to use the datasets we have collected to answer the central question.
  We then looked over each of the datasets to see if the dataset was needed to 
  help us answer the central question. During this process, we decided that the
  Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv was not necessary. We figured that this dataset
  which contained the survey results regarding the exposure of teens to tobacco,
  did not help figure out the reason of death in certain states in America.

- During our second meeting, we looked at the drug and state_crime datasets and
  chose the columns that may be helpful in answering the question. During this
  process, we dicided to use the data in the state of California and Texas, since
  these states showed relatively high population. We each spent time to work on 
  the function to filter the data.

- We also worked on the function to filer and clean our data so that we only
  have the data regarding the relevant columns we have chosen during the second
  meeting. We finalized all of our code and connected back to our central question.
  Wrote README.txt and LABREPORT.txt.
