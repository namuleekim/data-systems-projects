- First meeting, we decided who will attempt the DoL and who will attempt the LoL.
  Kim chose LoL and Yoon chose DoL. Agreed to meet again after trying on our own.
  Planned using repl.it as collaboration tool.

- After working on the functions separately, we met together to look over them to
  catch errors and make modifications. The DoL function needed more work so we
  collaborated to finish the DoL and finalized all the functions. 

# 26 February 2024
- Compiled all of our code into one main.py file. Wrote README.txt and LABREPORT.txt.
