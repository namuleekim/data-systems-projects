- First meeting, we discussed what data we should use as csv, xml, or json.
  We also spent some time looking over the data we have found and removed/added
  some data that we needed for the project. After that we started coding the 
  functions needed to read the data and construct a pandas DataFrame.

# 14 April 2024
- We spent some time separately working on the functions and met again to look
  over them. In this process, we had some issue constructing a pandas dataframe 
  from our json file. We made changes to our "json_to_dataframe" function to
  fix this issue. We also took care of some general errors when compiling
  and made modifications accordingly.

# 16 April 2024
- We took a final look at the entire project and made our code executable. "json
_to_dataframe" function was completed. We also spent time writing the README.txt
and LABREPORT.txt.
