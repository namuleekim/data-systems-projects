- First meeting, we looked over our central question to get a final picture and
  plan of how to use the datasets we have collected to answer the central 
  question. We then looked over each of the datasets to see if it was appropriate
  in our project. Therefore, we narrowed down to 4 datasets to create database
  from.

- After choosing which datasets to work with, we looked at each data and 
  determined which columns were needed and which were not based on the 
  information each column provided. We then spent time constructing functions
  that only contained the information that was necessary.

- We continued on working on functions to filter and clean our data. We finalized
  our functions and fixed some errors that popped up in the process. We also wrote
  README.txt and LABREPORT.txt.
